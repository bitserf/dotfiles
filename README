== Installation

Many ways, from simplest to most annoying.

    $ sh <(curl bitserf.org/setup)

This URL is set up to proxy to the newest script on GitHub. nginx proxy_pass
FTW!

Or, you could do

  $ sh <(curl https://raw.github.com/bitserf/dotfiles/master/bin/setup-dotfiles.sh)

Which is functionally identical to the first.

Lastly, if you're feeling so inclined, you could do what the script does by
hand.

  $ git clone git://github.com/bitserf/dotfiles.git dotfiles
  $ cd dotfiles
  $ ruby bin/link-dotfiles.rb
  $ git submodule update --init

Tested on OS X, FreeBSD, Ubuntu Linux and Arch Linux.
